However, in 1782 Polier supplied Richard Johnson with a copy of the Persian translation by Kishan Singh of the Brahmavaivarlapurāna based on a ms owned by Polier [see Falk and Archer Indian Miniatures in the India Office Library, pp.18-9 (which says the copy was illustrated and also refers to Johnson commissioning copies of mss belonging to Polier and to Martin)].","locus: locus":"","locus: from":"","locus: to":"","people: author name(s)":"","people: author ID(s)":"","people: scribe name(s)":"","people: scribe ID(s)":"","people: signer name(s)":"","people: signer ID(s)":"","people: former owner name(s)":"","people: former owner ID(s)":"","people: other person name(s)":"","people: other person ID(s)":"","bibliography: bibl(s)":"","bibliography: title(s)":"","bibliography: ref(s)":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shiva_Purana","bibliography: ref URI(s)":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shiva_Purana"},{"metadata: addition UID":"Eton Pote 283_addition_1","metadata: file URL":"manuscript_15422","metadata: collection":"","metadata: ms ID":"Eton Pote 283","metadata: shelfmark":"","metadata: ms type":"manuscript","metadata: part name":"","metadata: partID":"Eton_283","overview: additions":"F.1r: seal of Polier (1181);
